# Spec for a Cheap Executor

You are the expensive model. You do **all** of the thinking, once. The doc you produce is
executed by a **cheaper, less capable model** that has no context on this project, no access
to the user, and no ability to make a design call.

> **The bar:** a competent-but-literal executor applies this doc end to end and gets the
> intended result. **Anywhere it would have to guess, the doc is not finished.**

The doc is the only artifact the executor sees. It never sees this conversation, the
requirements discussion, or your reasoning. Write nothing that depends on them.

## The executor you are writing for

Design against this profile, not against an idealised reader:

| Trait | Consequence for the doc |
|-------|-------------------------|
| Literal | Follows a table exactly; follows a prose rule loosely. Prefer tables. |
| No project context | "Match the existing style" resolves to nothing. Name files, tokens, idioms. |
| Cannot ask | Every ambiguity resolves into improvisation. There is no clarification round. |
| Adds code readily, deletes almost never | Silent obsolescence is the #1 failure. Deletions must be explicit instructions with line numbers. |
| Optimistic about success | Will ship a silent no-op as "done". Label which outcomes mean something is wrong. |
| Won't derive | Any formula in prose becomes a wrong number. Ship the computed result or the literal function body. |

## Output

One doc = one shippable change.

- Default path: `docs/tasks/{NN}-{kebab-slug}.md` (`NN` = next free two-digit number). Confirm
  with the user if they name a different location.
- Markdown only. Self-contained. No links to conversation history, tickets, or "as discussed".

## Phase 0 — Intake & scope lock

Establish, asking only for what you genuinely cannot determine from the repo:

- [ ] The feature request, in the user's words
- [ ] **Is code in scope at all?** (docs-only specs are legitimate — say so explicitly)
- [ ] Files/areas that must **not** be touched
- [ ] Existing docs in `docs/tasks/` that this one overlaps or contradicts → Phase 4 becomes mandatory
- [ ] Which model executes it (affects verbosity, not rigour — assume Haiku-class if unstated)

Produce the Scope Box (template §1) now. Everything later is checked against it.

## Phase 1 — Ground truth: measure, never assume

Read the **real code** before proposing anything. This phase produces the Findings section,
and it is what earns the executor's trust: a doc it can spot-check is a doc it follows.

Rules:

- **No claim without `file.ext:line`.** Use markdown links (`[order_form_page.dart:212](lib/features/order/view/order_form_page.dart#L212)`).
- **Run the logic by hand and record real numbers.** Not "the multiplier grows too fast" but
  "at score 3.0 the formula prescribes 17 pull-ups × 5 sets". Not "the list rebuilds often"
  but "`OrderListPage` rebuilds all 40 cards on every keystroke".
- **Every number you record is also a regression-test fixture.** Compute at boundaries
  (min, max, zero, empty, null, first, last) — those become the assertions in §10.
- Banned in Findings: *appears to*, *probably*, *seems*, *should be*, *may*.

If a finding cannot be measured, either measure it (write and run a throwaway script in your
scratchpad) or drop it. An unmeasured finding is an assumption wearing a citation.

## Phase 2 — Decision ledger (the core mechanism)

Before writing the doc, enumerate in your scratchpad **every point where the executor could
choose differently than you intend**. Then convert each into a form that removes the choice:

| If the executor would have to… | Ship this instead | Never ship |
|--------------------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Derive a value from a formula | The computed value, or the literal function body | The formula described in prose |
| Select from a set | The exhaustive table, all N rows | "Isolation moves get 8–20 reps" |
| Judge spacing / colour / hierarchy | ASCII mockup with exact tokens per state | "Make it look consistent" |
| Know that old code is now dead | `delete X at file:472, nothing replaces it` | Silence |
| Pick an order | A numbered build order, each step compiling alone | "Implement the feature" |
| Decide whether an outcome is OK | An explicit normal / anomalous label | An unannotated early return |
| Recall a project idiom | The rule + one example + the rule-file path | Assumed familiarity |

The ledger is a working artifact — it does not ship. It is cleared only when **every row maps
to a concrete section of the doc**. A row you cannot place is a section you still owe.

## Phase 3 — Compose the doc

Follow [references/doc-template.md](references/doc-template.md) — all eleven sections, in
order, none omitted. A section with nothing to say says "None." and states why; it is never
silently dropped.

**Generate exhaustive tables programmatically.** When a table has more than ~10 rows, write a
generator script into your session scratchpad, run it, and paste the output into the doc.
Never hand-type a long table (you will skip rows) and never replace it with the rule that
produced it (the executor will misapply it). Long is fine; ambiguous is not.

**Cite this project's tooling by name** so the executor inherits conventions instead of
re-deriving them — see [references/project-composition.md](references/project-composition.md).

## Phase 4 — Coupling pass: corrections, not additions

Only when earlier docs exist. When one doc ships before another, the earlier one can make
statements in the later one **false**. Appending "note: see doc 03" is the wrong move — the
executor reads the stale text first and applies it.

Follow [references/coupling.md](references/coupling.md): delete the stale section, replace it,
fix every downstream reference (state fields, UI branches, test steps, build-order numbering),
and record what changed and why in the doc's changelog.

## Phase 5 — Adversarial self-audit

Re-read the finished doc **as the executor**: literal, contextless, unable to ask. Work
[references/audit-checklist.md](references/audit-checklist.md) line by line.

Every place you would have to guess goes back to Phase 2. Do not ship a doc with an open
ledger row — the executor's improvisation is exactly the cost this skill exists to avoid.

Finally, report to the user: the doc path, its section count, the exhaustive tables it
contains (with row counts), and any assumption you locked in on their behalf.

## After the executor runs

When the cheap model has executed the doc and the user comes back with bugs, call the Skill tool
with `triage-executor-bugs`. Bugs traced to an ambiguity in *this*
doc are `spec-defect`s: they oblige a correction here (via
[references/coupling.md](references/coupling.md)), not just a patch to the code. Recurring defect
classes get promoted into [references/audit-checklist.md](references/audit-checklist.md) so the
next spec prevents them.

## Hard rules

- **No `TODO`, no "decide during implementation", no "as appropriate".** If you are tempted,
  you have found a decision you have not made yet.
- **No prose algorithms.** If the executor would derive it, derive it in the doc.
- **No selection rules where a table fits.** Enumerate.
- **Deletions are instructions, not observations.** `file:line` + "nothing replaces it".
- **Every number carries its source** — a `file:line` for measured values, a named formula
  input for computed ones.
- **The doc is self-contained.** No "see the conversation", no ticket links as the only source
  of a requirement, no unexplained project jargon.
- **Name the project's skills, agents and rules explicitly** (`/flutter-write-tests`, the
  `flutter-state-engineer` agent, `.claude/rules/flutter-bloc.md`) rather than restating them.
- **Verification is executable** — real commands, exact assertions, and at least one test that
  must **fail before** a named step and **pass after** it.
