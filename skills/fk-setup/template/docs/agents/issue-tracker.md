# Issue tracker

Written by `/fk-setup`. The kit's `project-tracker` skill reads this file before it touches a
ticket, and owns the conventions: labels, ticket body, sprints. This file records only what is
true of this project.

## Where

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Tracker | GitHub Issues |
| Repo | `<owner>/<repo>` |
| Board | `<project number>` owned by `<@me or organisation>`, or `none` |
| Board Status options | `Todo`, `In Progress`, `Done` |

## Sprints

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Length | `<1 week>` |
| Starts on | `<Monday>` |
| Capacity for the next sprint | `<points, or "guess: N" until a sprint has closed>` |

Capacity is the average velocity of the last three closed sprints. Until one has closed it is a
guess, and every plan built on it says so.

## Velocity

One row per closed sprint, appended by `/fk-sprint close`.

| Sprint | Committed | Closed | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|

## Agent loop

`kit loop run` reads this table. It builds the current sprint's `ready-for-agent` tickets, drives
each pull request through CI and review, and labels it `ready-for-human` when it is yours to test
and merge. Which models it runs is a per-user setting (`kit models show`), not a project one.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Max parallel builds | `2` |
| Max review rounds | `3` |
| Max CI fixes | `3` |
| One-way door paths | `<extra globs, comma-separated, e.g. lib/core/storage/**>` |
| Worktrees | `<../<repo>-worktrees>` |
